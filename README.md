# mega10-python

This repository is an archive of my class work for this Udemy class.

The archive contains old samples of files, assignments, or notes.

The assignments folder contains the python files that were created with the various coding assignments and exercises that were assigned or presented within the first 12 chapters.

The applications folder contains the 10 applications that were the objective of this class. If these were single application files and their associated iterations they are in the root applications folder. If the application required multiple files for it's execution, a dedicated folder was created.

The files folder contains the reference files used in the applications.

Enjoy.
