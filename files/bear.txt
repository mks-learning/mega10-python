Python File I/O
In this tutorial, you'll learn about Python file operations. More specifically, opening a file, reading from it, writing into it, closing it, and various file methods that you should be aware of.
Files
Files are named locations on disk to store related information. They are used to permanently store data in a non-volatile memory (e.g. hard disk).

Since Random Access Memory (RAM) is volatile (which loses its data when the computer is turned off), we use files for future use of the data by permanently storing them.

When we want to read from or write to a file, we need to open it first. When we are done, it needs to be closed so that the resources that are tied with the file are freed.

Hence, in Python, a file operation takes place in the following order:

Open a file
Read or write (perform operation)
Close the file
